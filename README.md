# Create Rust GitHub repo

[![Build](https://github.com/DenisGorbachev/create-rust-github-repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DenisGorbachev/create-rust-github-repo)
[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/create-rust-github-repo/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/create-rust-github-repo)

## Overview

`create-rust-github-repo` is a CLI program that creates a new repository on GitHub, clones it locally, initializes a Rust project, copies the configs from a pre-existing directory.

## Examples

```shell
# Create a GitHub repo & init a Rust project
create-rust-github-repo --name my-new-project

# Copy configs from existing project
create-rust-github-repo --name my-new-project --copy-configs-from ~/workspace/my-existing-project --configs .github,rustfmt.toml,clippy.toml

# Clone to a specific directory
create-rust-github-repo --name my-new-project --dir ~/workspace/my-new-project

# Create a public repo
create-rust-github-repo --name my-new-project --repo-create-cmd "gh repo create --public {{name}}"

# Create a lib instead of bin
create-rust-github-repo --name my-new-project --project-init-cmd "cargo init --lib"
```

## Features

* [x] Uses existing `gh`, `git`, `cargo` commands
* [x] Supports overrides for all commands
* [x] Supports substitutions (see help below)
* [x] Can be used as a library

## Installation

```shell
cargo install create-rust-github-repo
```

## Usage

```
`create-rust-github-repo` is a CLI program that creates a new repository on GitHub, clones it locally, initializes a Rust project, copies the configs from a pre-existing directory.

Usage: create-rust-github-repo [OPTIONS] --name <NAME>

Options:
  -n, --name <NAME>
          Repository name

  -d, --dir <DIR>
          Target directory for cloning the repository (must include the repo name) (defaults to "{current_dir}/{repo_name}") (see also: --workspace)

  -w, --workspace <WORKSPACE>
          Parent of the target directory for cloning the repository (must NOT include the repo name). If this option is specified, then the repo is cloned to "{workspace}/{repo_name}". The --dir option overrides this option

      --shell-cmd <SHELL_CMD>
          Shell to use for executing commands
          
          [default: /bin/sh]

      --shell-args <SHELL_ARGS>
          Shell args to use for executing commands (note that '-c' is always passed as last arg)

  -c, --copy-configs-from <COPY_CONFIGS_FROM>
          Source directory for config paths

      --configs <CONFIGS>
          Config paths separated by comma (relative to `copy_configs_from`) (only applies if `copy_configs_from` is specified) (supports files and directories)

      --repo-exists-cmd <REPO_EXISTS_CMD>
          Shell command to check if repo exists (supports substitutions - see help below)
          
          [default: "gh repo view --json nameWithOwner {{name}} 2>/dev/null"]

      --repo-create-cmd <REPO_CREATE_CMD>
          Shell command to create a repo (supports substitutions - see help below)
          
          [default: "gh repo create --private {{name}}"]

      --repo-clone-cmd <REPO_CLONE_CMD>
          Shell command to clone a repo (supports substitutions - see help below)
          
          [default: "gh repo clone {{name}} {{dir}}"]

      --project-init-cmd <PROJECT_INIT_CMD>
          Shell command to initialize a project (supports substitutions - see help below)
          
          [default: "cargo init"]

      --project-test-cmd <PROJECT_TEST_CMD>
          Shell command to test a project (supports substitutions - see help below)
          
          [default: "cargo test"]

      --repo-add-args <REPO_ADD_ARGS>
          Shell command to add new files (supports substitutions - see help below)
          
          [default: "git add ."]

      --repo-commit-args <REPO_COMMIT_ARGS>
          Shell command to make a commit (supports substitutions - see help below)
          
          [default: "git commit -m \"feat: setup project\""]

      --repo-push-args <REPO_PUSH_ARGS>
          Shell command to push the commit (supports substitutions - see help below)
          
          [default: "git push"]

  -s, --support-link-probability <SUPPORT_LINK_PROBABILITY>
          The probability of seeing a support link in a single execution of the command is `1 / {{this-field-value}}`.
          
          Set it to 0 to disable the support link.
          
          [env: SUPPORT_LINK_PROBABILITY=]
          [default: 1]

      --dry-run
          Don't actually execute commands that modify the data, only print them (note that read-only commands will still be executed)

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version

All command arg options support the following substitutions:
* {{name}} - substituted with --name arg
* {{dir}} - substituted with resolved directory for repo (the resolved value of --dir)
```
